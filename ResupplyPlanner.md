# **Elite: Dangerous Fleet Carrier Route Planner \- Project Overview**

This document outlines the technical approach for building a companion application for Elite: Dangerous, with a primary focus on long-range route planning for Fleet Carriers. The goal is to provide a highly accurate and efficient tool for the community, initially hosted on a Linode server for development and testing.

## **1\. Project Goal**

To develop a web-based companion application that enables Elite: Dangerous players to plan extensive, multi-jump routes for their Fleet Carriers. This tool aims to replicate and potentially enhance the capabilities of existing popular route planners by leveraging a local, up-to-date galaxy database.

## **2\. Data Source Strategy**

Maintaining an accurate and comprehensive galaxy map is central to this project. Our strategy involves a two-pronged approach, prioritizing the real-time data stream:

*   **Ongoing Data Updates (EDDN Firehose \- Setup First):** We will first integrate with the Elite Dangerous Data Network (EDDN) by setting up a ZeroMQ (ZMQ) subscriber client. This will allow us to immediately begin listening to the tcp://eddn.edcd.io:9500/ stream, filtering for relevant Commodity and Journal schema messages that contain system coordinate updates or new system discoveries. This ensures our mechanism for keeping data current is robust before importing historical data.  
*   **Initial Bulk Data Load (After EDDN Setup):** Once the EDDN processing and upserting mechanism is stable and proven, we will proceed with the bulk import. We will manually download the systems.json.gz data dump from Spansh (over 158 million star system records, approximately 26 GB uncompressed). This data will then be imported into our database in chunks, allowing EDDN to fill in any gaps or updates that occurred since the dump was generated.

## **3. Database Choice: PostgreSQL with PostGIS**

Given the need for robust spatial querying and advanced data types, this project uses **PostgreSQL** with the **PostGIS** extension. This combination provides powerful geographic object support, efficient indexing for coordinate-based searches, and native array types, making it an ideal choice for handling galactic-scale data.

### **Database Schema**

The database is composed of four core tables: `systems`, `commodities`, `stations`, and `station_commodities`. The full, up-to-date schema can be found in the `scripts/create_systems_pg.sql` file.

#### **`systems` table**
Stores all star systems and their coordinates.

```sql
CREATE TABLE systems (
    system_address BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    x DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    y DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    z DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    coords GEOMETRY(PointZ, 0) NOT NULL,
    requires_permit BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
CREATE INDEX idx_systems_name ON systems (name);
CREATE INDEX idx_systems_coords ON systems USING GIST (coords);
```

#### **`commodities` table**
Stores all unique commodity types encountered.

```sql
CREATE TABLE commodities (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
CREATE INDEX idx_commodities_name ON commodities (name);
```

#### **`stations` table**
Stores all stations, outposts, and fleet carriers where markets are found.

```sql
CREATE TABLE stations (
    market_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    system_address BIGINT REFERENCES systems(system_address) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    prohibited TEXT[],
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
CREATE INDEX idx_stations_system_address ON stations(system_address);
```

#### **`station_commodities` table**
A joining table that lists all commodities available at a specific station, including their buy/sell prices, demand, and stock levels.

```sql
CREATE TABLE station_commodities (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    station_market_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES stations(market_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    commodity_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES commodities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    buy_price INTEGER NOT NULL,
    sell_price INTEGER NOT NULL,
    demand INTEGER NOT NULL,
    demand_bracket INTEGER NOT NULL,
    stock INTEGER NOT NULL,
    stock_bracket INTEGER NOT NULL,
    mean_price INTEGER NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT _station_commodity_uc UNIQUE (station_market_id, commodity_id)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_station_commodities_updated_at ON station_commodities (updated_at);
```

-- Essential Spatial Index for fast proximity queries  
```sql
CREATE SPATIAL INDEX idx_systems_coords ON systems(coords);
```

### **Initial Data Import (Bulk Load Process)**

After the EDDN listener is successfully processing live updates, the 26 GB systems.json.gz dump will be manually downloaded. A temporary script will be developed to:

1. Decompress the systems.json.gz file using a gzip compatible library.  
2. Parse the JSON, extracting id, name, x, y, z, and primary\_star\_type.  
3. Convert the parsed data into a format suitable for MySQL's LOAD DATA INFILE command (e.g., CSV).  
4. Perform the import in chunks over several hours, leveraging LOAD DATA INFILE for its speed.  
5. **Crucially, spatial indexes should be created *after* the bulk data load is complete for optimal performance.**

Once this bulk import is finished, the continuously running EDDN listener will keep the database upserted with any new or changed information.

## **4\. Key Technical Challenges & Components**

### **a. Data Ingestion & Management**

*   **EDDN Listener & Processor:** This is the first component to be developed. A ZeroMQ (ZMQ) subscriber client will connect to the EDDN tcp://eddn.edcd.io:9500/ stream. It will parse incoming JSON messages, filter for Commodity and Journal schemas containing system data, and perform upserts (update or insert) to keep the local systems table current.

    #### Listener Architecture & Operation
    To ensure the listener is robust and reliable for long-term operation, it is designed with two distinct components: a core application and an external process supervisor.

    *   **Core Listener Application:** A Python script responsible for the primary logic:
        *   **Graceful Startup/Shutdown:** Ensures clean handling of ZMQ sockets and database connections.
        *   **ZMQ Subscription:** Connects to the EDDN feed and subscribes to messages.
        *   **Processing Loop:** An infinite loop that receives, decompresses, and parses messages. It identifies messages by their `$schemaRef` and filters for schemas relevant to system data and commodity markets.
        *   **Stale Message Handling:** A critical rule to prevent data corruption from out-of-order messages. Before any update, the listener will compare the `header.timestamp` of the incoming message with the `updated_at` timestamp in the database. If the message's timestamp is not strictly newer than the database record, it will be discarded and logged at the `INFO` level. This ensures the database always reflects the most recent known state of a system.
        *   **Periodic Stats Logging:** To avoid log spam from the high-volume stream, the listener will not log every ignored message. Instead, it will log a summary statistic every 60 seconds (e.g., `Processed=X, Accepted=Y, Ignored=Z`) to provide a clear, high-level view of its health and activity.
        *   **Error Handling:** The main loop will be wrapped in robust `try...except` blocks to log errors (e.g., malformed JSON, database issues) without crashing the service.

    *   **Process Supervisor (`systemd`):** Rather than building custom process management logic, the listener will be managed as a `systemd` service. This is the standard, pragmatic approach on modern Linux systems and provides critical features out-of-the-box:
        *   **Singleton Guarantee:** Ensures only one instance of the listener is ever running.
        *   **Automatic Restarts:** Automatically restarts the script if it crashes (`Restart=always`).
        *   **Watchdog:** Monitors the script for hangs or deadlocks. The Python script will periodically notify `systemd` that it is healthy. If a notification isn't received within a configured timeout (e.g., 90 seconds), `systemd` will automatically restart the service.
        *   **Daemonization:** Manages running the script as a true background service and handles its log output.

    #### Testing Strategy for the EDDN Listener
    Adhering to our pragmatic testing philosophy, testing for this component will be focused and strategic:
    *   **Unit Tests:** We will *not* write unit tests for the main listener loop itself, as it primarily orchestrates external libraries (`pyzmq`, `SQLAlchemy`) and would require complex mocking for little value. Our existing unit tests for `config.py` and `crud.py` already cover the core business and data logic that the listener will consume.
    *   **Integration Testing:** The primary method for testing the listener will be through integration testing. This involves running the listener in a controlled environment and verifying its behavior by:
        1.  Observing the log output for the periodic stats messages.
        2.  Checking that errors are being logged correctly without crashing the service.
        3.  Querying the database to confirm that system data is being inserted and updated as expected from live EDDN messages.
        4.  Testing the `systemd` service itself (start, stop, restart) to ensure it correctly manages the listener process.

*   **MySQL Setup & Optimization:** Configuring MySQL 8.0+ on the Linode server with appropriate memory (innodb_buffer_pool_size), I/O, and indexing settings for a dataset of this scale.  
* **Spansh Dump Bulk Importer:** A temporary script to handle the one-time, chunked import of the systems.json.gz data dump into MySQL, as described above.

### **b. Route Planning Algorithm (A\* Search)**

* **Core Algorithm:** Implementation of the A\* pathfinding algorithm.  
  * **Nodes:** Star systems retrieved from the local MySQL database.  
  * **Edges:** Represent potential jumps between systems. An edge exists if the ST\_Distance between two system coords is less than or equal to the Fleet Carrier's maximum jump range (500 LY).  
  * **Heuristic:** Euclidean distance (straight-line distance) from the current system to the destination system.  
  * **Cost:** Tritium consumption per jump (proportional to jump distance).  
* **Fleet Carrier Specifics:** The algorithm must account for:  
  * A fixed **500 LY jump range** per jump.  
  * **No neutron star boosting** for Fleet Carriers (this simplifies the algorithm compared to ship plotting).  
  * Tritium fuel management (though for 10,000 LY, a full carrier typically has enough fuel).  
* **Iterative Querying:** The A\* algorithm will iteratively query the local MySQL database for systems within the 500 LY jump range of the current node, expanding its search until the destination is reached. This avoids loading the entire galaxy into memory.

### **c. Web Application Development**

* **Backend:** A web framework (e.g., Python/Flask/Django, Node.js/Express, etc.) to serve the web UI and expose API endpoints for route planning requests. This backend will interact with the local MySQL database.  
* **Frontend:** A web UI (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/React/Vue.js) to allow users to input start/end systems, view plotted routes, and interact with the application.  
  * Initial development can focus on a functional command-line interface for testing the core routing logic.

## **5\. Deployment Environment**

The project will initially be hosted on a Linode server. We will monitor resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk I/O) closely to inform future scaling decisions.  
This project combines large-scale data management, efficient spatial querying, and complex pathfinding to create a valuable tool for the Elite: Dangerous community.

## **6\. Redis-Based Autocomplete System**

### **Overview**

The autocomplete system for system names is a critical component for user experience, enabling fast, responsive system name suggestions as users type. Given the dynamic nature of the galaxy data (new systems are discovered and added every minute via EDDN), a Redis-based solution provides significant advantages over file-based approaches.

### **Why Redis for Autocomplete?**

#### **Performance Benefits**
* **Sub-millisecond response times** for prefix matching queries
* **In-memory operations** eliminate disk I/O bottlenecks
* **Native sorted set operations** optimized for lexicographic range queries
* **Atomic operations** ensure thread-safe updates from multiple sources

#### **Real-time Updates**
* **Immediate availability** of new system names without file reloading
* **Dynamic data integration** with the EDDN listener
* **No downtime** for autocomplete service during updates
* **Consistent state** across all application instances

#### **Scalability**
* **Memory efficient** - approximately 30-60 MB for full galaxy dataset
* **Horizontal scaling** - can be shared across multiple application instances
* **Built-in persistence** - RDB/AOF for durability without performance impact
* **Connection pooling** - efficient resource utilization

### **Technical Architecture**

#### **Redis Data Structure: Sorted Set**
```redis
# Key: "systems:names"
# Members: System names
# Scores: Lexicographic ordering (0 for all, using names as natural sort)
ZADD systems:names 0 "Sol"
ZADD systems:names 0 "Alpha Centauri"
ZADD systems:names 0 "Barnard's Star"
```

#### **Autocomplete Query Pattern**
```redis
# Prefix search using lexicographic range
# [prefix] to [prefix\xff] gives all names starting with prefix
ZRANGEBYLEX systems:names "[Sol" "[Sol\xff"
```

#### **Performance Characteristics**
* **Query time**: < 1ms for any prefix length
* **Memory usage**: ~20-30 bytes per system name
* **Update time**: < 1ms per system addition
* **Concurrent reads**: Unlimited
* **Concurrent writes**: Atomic operations handle conflicts

### **Implementation Components**

#### **1. Redis Integration Layer**
```python
# src/app/redis_client.py
import redis
from typing import List, Optional

class SystemAutocomplete:
    def __init__(self, redis_url: str = "redis://localhost:6379"):
        self.redis = redis.from_url(redis_url)
        self.key = "systems:names"
    
    def add_system(self, name: str) -> bool:
        """Add a system name to the autocomplete index."""
        return self.redis.zadd(self.key, {name: 0}) > 0
    
    def search_prefix(self, prefix: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[str]:
        """Search for systems matching the given prefix."""
        start = f"[{prefix}"
        end = f"[{prefix}\xff"
        return self.redis.zrangebylex(self.key, start, end, 0, limit)
    
    def get_stats(self) -> dict:
        """Get autocomplete system statistics."""
        total = self.redis.zcard(self.key)
        memory = self.redis.memory_usage(self.key) or 0
        return {
            "total_systems": total,
            "memory_bytes": memory,
            "memory_mb": memory / 1024 / 1024
        }
```

    def __init__(self):
        self.autocomplete = SystemAutocomplete()
    
    def process_system_message(self, message: dict):
        """Process system data and update both PostgreSQL and Redis."""
        # Existing PostgreSQL logic...
        
        # Add to Redis autocomplete
        system_name = message.get('name')
        if system_name:
            self.autocomplete.add_system(system_name)
```

#### **3. FastAPI Endpoints**
```python

@app.get("/api/autocomplete/systems")
async def search_systems(q: str, limit: int = 10):
    """Search for systems by prefix."""
    if len(q) < 1:
        raise HTTPException(400, "Query must be at least 1 character")
    
    results = autocomplete.search_prefix(q, limit)
    return {
        "query": q,
        "results": results,
        "count": len(results)
    }

@app.get("/api/autocomplete/stats")
async def get_autocomplete_stats():
    """Get autocomplete system statistics."""
    return autocomplete.get_stats()
```

#### **4. Bulk Data Loading**
```python
# scripts/load_systems_to_redis.py
import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))

from src.app.redis_client import SystemAutocomplete
from src.app.database import get_db
from src.app.models import System

def load_all_systems_to_redis():
    """Bulk load all system names from PostgreSQL to Redis."""
    autocomplete = SystemAutocomplete()
    
    with get_db() as db:
        # Stream results to avoid memory issues
        query = db.query(System.name).order_by(System.name)
        
        total_added = 0
        for system in query.yield_per(1000):
            if autocomplete.add_system(system.name):
                total_added += 1
            
            if total_added % 10000 == 0:
                print(f"Added {total_added:,} systems to Redis...")
        
        print(f"Completed! Added {total_added:,} systems to Redis")
        
        # Show final stats
        stats = autocomplete.get_stats()
        print(f"Redis stats: {stats}")
```
