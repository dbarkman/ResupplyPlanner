# MariaDB/MySQL Configuration for ResupplyPlanner
#
# This is an example configuration file. To use it, you can copy its contents
# into your server's main configuration file (e.g., /etc/mysql/my.cnf or
# a new file in /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf).
#
# **Always back up your existing configuration before making changes.**
# **You must restart the MariaDB service for changes to take effect.**

[mysqld]

# --- InnoDB Buffer Pool (Most Important Setting) ---
# This is the cache for your data and indexes. For a database-heavy
# application, this should be set to 50-70% of your server's total RAM
# to minimize disk I/O and maximize performance.
# Example for a server with 8GB of RAM:
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 4G

# --- Write Performance Tuning (For EDDN Listener) ---
# This setting trades a tiny amount of risk for a huge gain in write speed.
# 1 = Safest, but slow (flush to disk on every commit).
# 2 = Much faster (flush to disk once per second).
# For our use case (high-volume data stream), the performance gain from '2'
# is well worth the negligible risk of losing <1s of data in a power outage.
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2

# --- Transaction Log File Size ---
# A larger log file size improves efficiency on write-heavy workloads by
# reducing the frequency of log flushes to disk.
innodb_log_file_size = 256M

# --- Other General Recommendations ---
# Recommended to prevent potential character set issues.
